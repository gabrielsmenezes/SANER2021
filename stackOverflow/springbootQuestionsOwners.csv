But I'm mostly backend. I'm not a front-end artist, everything I design looks like squares ;-) I'm interested in higher ed, aerospace, AI, algorithms (Genetic, Neural Networks, LP), software security (OWASP, bugcrowd, defcon, etc). My goal this year is to get my half marathon time under 2 hours; best time so far 2:01:29s, arggg ;-)  [edit: I'm down to 1h47 for the half marathon as of April 2016 and 4h13 for the marathon]. Did you know Alan Turing was a very good marathon runner [under 3h on the marathon]?. Also, if you remember those old priceline ads: ""I looove to trravel""</p>
