<h2>Second-Generation Books</h2>

<p>His most recent books have been focused on second-generation Android app development (Kotlin and the Android Jetpack):</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href=""https://commonsware.com/Jetpack"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Elements of Android Jetpack</em></a>, a new introductory book on Android app development, focused on second-generation techniques. Version 0.8 is available, with 880 pages, covering Android Studio 3.5.3 and up through Android 10.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""https://commonsware.com/AndExplore"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Exploring Android</em></a>, a series of step-by-step tutorials for building an Android app from scratch. This book is being rewritten to demonstrate using Kotlin and the Jetpack libraries. Version 1.0 is available, with 36 tutorials spanning 576 pages.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""https://commonsware.com/R"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Elements of Android R</em></a>, to help you deal with the changes introduced by Android 11 (code-named ""R""). Version 0.1 is available, with 84 pages of material on everything from scoped storage changes to data access auditing to sharing UIs between apps.</p></li>

first-class reactive programming system. Version 0.1 is available, comprising 170 pages.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>First-Generation Books</h2>

<p>In the beginning, Android development was focused on Java and, partially, on the Android Support Library. Mark's earliest books share that focus:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href=""https://commonsware.com/Android"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>The Busy Coder's Guide to Android Development</em></a>, the first and largest book on Android app programming</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""https://commonsware.com/AndroidArch"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>Android's Architecture Components</em></a></p></li>
<li><p><a href=""https://commonsware.com/GraphQL"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>GraphQL and Android</em></a></p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Things Other Than Books</h2>

<p>He runs the <a href=""https://jetc.dev"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>jetc.dev</code></a> weekly newsletter for Jetpack Compose.</p>

<p>He also offers <a href=""https://commonsware.com/office-hours/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">office hours chats</a> and <a href=""https://commonsware.com/consulting"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">consulting</a> on Android app development, in case you are interested in help beyond what fits the Stack Overflow model, the books, and the training.</p>

<p>Heck, he even has <a href=""http://commonsware.com/blog"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a blog</a>.</p>

<p>I've taught programming classes in BASIC and Pascal mainly at high school level but some at two community colleges.</p>

<p>I dabbled in C+ (typical grade in humanities courses; weird-sounding guitar chord; and the compiler) but <em>objected</em> to the accompanying disorientation that were objects. However...</p>

<p>For a decade I've been ""into"" VBasic 6.0 and VBA, thus acquiring some sort of barebones intro in the vicinity of object-oriented ""stuff"" and now ... </p>

<p>... definitely last (after a brief fling at Javascript) but certainly not least: <strong>Java</strong>.</p>

<p>But gee whiz what a trip it's been so far for the 5 or so months I've been seriously trying. Messing with Z80 assembly language had a more palatable learning curve.</p>

<p><strong>I just today--January 13, 2018--paid @Commonsware $20 for a 4,000++ page book (The Busy Coder's Guide to Android Development) and access to untold wealth. I wish I had begun my quest of Java with this material.</strong> (<em>YOU should own it, M_. Android Developer!</em>) <strong>But such was not the case. Instead...</strong></p>

<p>I deliberately sought and bought an Oreilly book by Pat Niemeyer and, after mostly-profitlessly struggling thru the previews and don't-do's and rambling verbosity and cuteness ... well, the title is ""Learning Java"", but it should be more like ""Learn the History and Details of Java Once You Know Java."" I hate it as an initial text.</p>

<p>I also bought Sams' (Cadenhead) Teach Yourself Java in 21 Days (pretty good; it is what it says--i.e., sort of lightweight) and am considering Ivor Horton's Beginning Java, which is very detailed in terms of threads and GUIs and other stuff. The ""For Dummies"" book I initially bought stood up well for a couple of weeks (it is what it says, too). </p>

<p>In short, though, I'm getting the hang of it: threads, events, GUIs, directory tree walking, generics... </p>

<p>And GridBagLayout has freed me from Netbeans GUIbuilder. I heartily recommend investigating it.</p>

<p>P.S. My graphic is a zoomed-in region of a sort-of-northwest part of the Mandelbrot set. Wrote code to make it many years ago; found Java code to create the initial picture; modified it to allow zoom-in. Math's purty, ain't it?</p>

Before I came to CMU for further education, I had worked as a Software Design Engineer in Usher Android Team for MicroStrategy for more than 3 years and as a Software Engineer for LightInTheBox for around 3 years. In these 6 years,  I have experienced in designing and developing production systems in the fields of ERP, electronic business &amp; mobile security. Driving by the passion for building best-in-class Android applications, I have kept a close eye and interaction in the evolution of Android System with solid understanding of Android Framework. I am a big fan of Android Studio, Gradle and other hot Android open source projects in GitHub such as RxJava, Dagger, Retrofit and so on. I am familiar with Server Framework such as Spring, Hibernate, Struts and Servlet and experienced in developing Backend service API. In regarding to my personality, I believe that a man should not only take responsibility but also honor in his job and as a human being, the most invaluable merits that a man could possess are exactly the nature of a powerful robot, which are stability, reliability &amp; predictability.</p>

This has resulted in productive and efficient environments along with increased job satisfaction and enjoyment.</p>
